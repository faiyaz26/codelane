## When You Need a Commercial License

You need a commercial license if you want to:

### ✅ Build Proprietary Features
- Add closed-source premium features to Codelane
- Create a proprietary fork without sharing source code
- Integrate Codelane into a closed-source product

### ✅ Run as a Service Without Sharing Source
- Offer Codelane as a SaaS/hosted service with modifications
- Run a modified version on network servers without publishing source
- Use Codelane in a commercial cloud offering

### ✅ Redistribute Without Copyleft
- Bundle Codelane in a commercial product
- Distribute modified versions under different terms
- Avoid AGPL-3.0's copyleft requirements

## What the AGPL-3.0 Requires (Why You'd Want Commercial)

Under AGPL-3.0, you **must**:
- Keep all modifications open source under AGPL-3.0
- Share source code if you run it as a network service

**Commercial license removes these requirements.**
