You need a commercial license if you want to:

- Build proprietary/closed-source features on top of Codelane
- Run Codelane as a SaaS/hosted service with modifications

- Use Codelane without AGPL-3.0's copyleft requirements

Under AGPL-3.0, all modifications must be open source. A commercial license removes this requirement.
